# Fairness-Optimization-In-Machine-Learning-Models-A-Case-Study-on-the-Compas-Dataset
Fairness optimization in machine learning aims to reduce bias so models treat all groups equitably. The COMPAS dataset, used to predict recidivism risk, reveals racial biases in predictions. Optimizing fairness on COMPAS involves balancing accurate predictions while minimizing disparities among demographic groups.
Project Overview
This project explores fairness optimization techniques applied to machine learning models using the COMPAS dataset, which predicts recidivism risk. It aims to reduce bias in model predictions across demographic groups while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Motivation
Machine learning models can perpetuate or amplify societal biases, especially in sensitive areas like criminal justice. This project highlights the importance of measuring and mitigating such biases to ensure equitable AI systems.

Dataset
COMPAS dataset: Contains criminal defendant information and recidivism outcomes.

Widely used in fairness research due to documented biases in predictions.

Methodology
Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

Model training with fairness constraints or reweighting.

Evaluation using fairness metrics such as demographic parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity.

Comparison with baseline models without fairness optimization.

Results
Quantitative results highlighting improvements in fairness.

Discussion of trade-offs between fairness and accuracy.
